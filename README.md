## Objectives:

- To develop a software tool that automatically classifies EEG (Electroencephalogram) data in one of four classes: inter-ictal (normal EEG pattern); pre-ictal (two minutes prior to the seizure onset); ictal (the seizure onset); pos-ictal (two minutes subsequent to seizure end). A typical epileptic seizure event is characterized by a cycle of those four stages.
- This code serves as a supplement to the conference paper [Towards Personalized Neural Networks for Epileptic Seizure Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-87559-8_50).


## Outputs:

- The data used in this investigation has been collected from the epilepsy database of Freiburg Center for Data Analysis and Modeling (FDM) of Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg - EPILEPSIAE: Evolving Platform for Improving Living Expectations of Patients Suffering from IctAl Events, an FP7 ICT eHealth project.

- During an extensive experimentation, different neural network architectures have been applied to the datasets and compared. The best architectures of the neural networks have been selected and integrated in a MATLAB tool. The tool allows the users to select the EEG dataset, the neural network architecture and test the epileptic seizure events recognition performance.

- The source code and documentation of the application is available here.

- Software tool developed in collaboration with Joao Duarte during the Adaptive Computing and Diffuse Systems course.
